   board, trying to form a straight line with three kernels. These 
   lines can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. If a Player gets 
   forms a straight line he/she must yell: pitzahua. I take a way an 
   opponents kernel from the board.

   to adjacent spaces. Players may not jump any kernels.

     a. She/he has collected the most opponent kernels, or 
     b. His/her opponent has only two kernels on the board

   and no player has been able to form a straight line with three 
   kernels.
